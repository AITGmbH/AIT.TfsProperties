AIT TfsProperties
========================

The AIT TfsProperties lets you set properties of Team Projects in TFS that are initially set by property-tags in the classification.xml of the used process template. The tool is a console application which uses TFS API to modify the formerly named properties.

##Getting started:
- AIT TfsProperties depends on Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client.dll (TFS Client Object Model), which is not part of the repository
- This assembly comes with Team Explorer / Visual Studio 2013

##Currently supported TFS-Versions:


- TFS 2013

It is planned to upgrade to TFS 2015
